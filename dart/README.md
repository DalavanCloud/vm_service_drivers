# vm_service_lib

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/vm_service_lib.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/vm_service_lib)

A library to access the VM Service Protocol.

## Usage

See the
[example](https://github.com/dart-lang/vm_service_drivers/blob/master/dart/example/vm_service_lib_tester.dart)
for a simple use of the library's API.

The VM Service Protocol spec can be found at
[github.com/dart-lang/sdk/runtime/vm/service/service.md](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/runtime/vm/service/service.md).

## Caveat emptor

The API of the library is under construction, and prone to change at any time.
We'll keep the version of the library below `0.1.0` as we work on it, and rev.
above that once the API is stable. We'll likely have the library's version
follow the protocol's version very closely.
